#You might have noticed that the <div> 
#tag doesnâ€™t change the appearance of your HTML code in the browser. As mentioned earlier, 
#its only purpose is to meaningfully organize our HTML elements for ourselves. In index7.html, the <div> tags divided the body into two logical sections, 
#where each section contained a heading and a paragraph. The reason for the appropriate use of <div> tags is that they make the code easier to read. And, code 
#readability becomes more important as the code gets longer.




<body>
    <div>
        <h2>First heading</h2>
        <p>First paragraph</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2>Second heading</h2>
        <p>Second heading</p>
    </div>
